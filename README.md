Mocha is a javascript framework for Node.js which allows Asynchronous testing.

Chai: Assertion Library
So with Mocha we actually have the environment for making our tests but how do we do test HTTP calls for example? Moreover, How do we test whether a GET request is actually returning the JSON file we are expective, given a defined input? We need an assertion library, thatâ€™s why mocha is not enough.
